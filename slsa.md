The table below describes how Docker Official Images (DOI) meet the [SLSA V1.0](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/) (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Level 3 build requirements.



| Level | Requirement | Implementation
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build L1: Provenance exists | Software producer follows a consistent build process so that others can form expectations about what a “correct” build looks like. | The whole [DOI build process](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images) is open, and there are strict rules that must be followed to be considered part of DOI. For example, dependencies should be pinned and digests checked when package managers are not used. For more details, see the docs on [creating a new DOI](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing-to-the-standard-library) |
|  | Provenance exists describing how the artifact was built, including the build platform, build process, and top-level inputs. | DOIs are build using [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/), and the corresponding OCI indices include [provenance](https://docs.docker.com/build/attestations/slsa-provenance/) |
|  | Software producer distributes provenance to consumers, preferably using a convention determined by the package ecosystem.| Provenance attestations are distributed as standard OCI artifacts, and conform to open [In-Toto](https://in-toto.io/) and [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance) specifications |
|Build L2: Hosted build platform|Build platform runs on dedicated infrastructure, not an individual’s workstation, and the provenance is tied to that infrastructure through a digital signature1.| [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/docker-library/meta/actions) runs the build workloads, and workload identity is used to sign provenance. Build triggering (which does not affect the build output) is a process that [runs on Jenkins](https://doi-janky.infosiftr.net/) |
||Downstream verification of provenance includes validating the authenticity of the provenance.|A Verification Summary Attestation (VSA) is created from a version controlled and securely distributed policy that validates the authenticity of the build-time attestations|
| Build L3: Hardened builds | Build platform implements strong controls to prevent runs from influencing one another, even within the same project. | Each build is performed on a clean node isolated from all other workloads. Where caching is used, it is provided by BuildKit, which has strict requirements around reproducibility (same inputs yield the same outputs). |
||Build platform implements strong controls to prevent secret material used to sign the provenance from being accessible to the user-defined build steps.| Secret key matrial is held in Cloud KMS within HSMs and cannot be read by any process. Workload identity is used to authenticate with the KMS for the signing of attestations |
